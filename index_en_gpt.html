                        Crusader Kings III is a grand strategy role-playing video game set in the Middle Ages. The game starts in 867 and usually ends in the 15th century, 
                        showcasing the medieval world and illustrating how feudalism and diplomacy worked. This game is unique among Paradox 
                        grand strategy games because you don't control a country; instead, you control a character, a ruler who manages titles like empires, kingdoms, duchies, or baronies. 
                        It is one of the most chaotic games on the list due to the randomness of NPC actions, but this only makes the game more replayable.

                        Europa Universalis IV is a strategy game where players can control a nation from the Late Middle Ages through the early modern period, engaging in trade, administration, diplomacy, colonization, and warfare. 
                        The game is divided into four ages: Age of Discovery, Age of Reformation, Age of Absolutism, and Age of Revolution. Each age has its own special 
                        mechanics and events (like the Burgundian inheritance in the Age of Discovery). This game is challenging for new players, but, unlike some other games on this list, all main activities in this game feel complete and interesting.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>All games are very different in terms of gameplay and require some patience from the player. 
                If you like slow-paced games where you can pause and think for a minute, I can definitely recommend these games.</p>
