                        Crusader Kings III is a grand strategy role-playing video game set in the Middle Ages. Game starts in 867 and usually end in 15th century, 
                        this game is really good in showing medieval word, showing how feudalism and diplomacy worked. This game is not like other Paradox 
                        grand strategy games because you don't control a country in it, you control a character, a ruler who controls titles like empires, kingdoms, duchies or baronies. 
                        This is one of the most chaotic games on the list because of randomness of NPC actions but it only makes this game more replayable.

                        Europa Universalis IV is a strategy game where players can control a nation from the Late Middle Ages through the early modern period conducting trade, administration, diplomacy, colonization, and warfare. 
                        The game is divided by 4 ages: Age of Discovery, Age of Reformation, Age of Absolutism and Age of Revolution. Each age has its own special 
                        mechanics and events (like Burgundian inheritance in Age of Discovery). This is a hard game for new player but, unlike in some other game on this list, all main activities in this game feel complete and interesting.
