                        Crusader Kings III is a grand strategy role-playing video game set in the Middle Ages. Game starts in 867 and usually end in 15th century, 
                        this game is really good in showing medieval word, showing how feudalism and diplomacy worked. This game is not like other Paradox 
                        grand strategy games because you don't control a country in it, you control a character, a ruler who controls titles like empires, kingdoms, duchies or baronies. 
                        This is one of the most chaotic games on the list because of randomness of NPC actions but it only makes this game more replayable.

                        Europa Universalis IV is a strategy game where players can control a nation from the Late Middle Ages through the early modern period conducting trade, administration, diplomacy, colonization, and warfare. 
                        The game is divided by 4 ages: Age of Discovery, Age of Reformation, Age of Absolutism and Age of Revolution. Each age has its own special 
                        mechanics and events (like Burgundian inheritance in Age of Discovery). This is a hard game for new player but, unlike in some other game on this list, all main activities in this game feel complete and interesting.

                        Victoria 3 is a grand strategy game with elements of society and economy simulation. Its best features are economy and internal politics, 
                        it implements demand and supply, goods shortages, class fights, revolutions and colonization. The only thing that i don't like in this game is warfare, it is not as interesting as in other Paradox games and often wars are won or lost because of random NPC behavior. 
                        Sometimes economy also feels a bit too complicated (predecessor of this game, Victoria 2, was called a spreadsheet simulator).

                        Hearts of Iron IV (HoI4) is a grand strategy video game that immerses players in the tumultuous landscape of World War II. 
                        The game challenges players to lead a nation through the complex web of military and political decisions that defined the era. 
                        With a meticulous focus on historical accuracy and attention to detail, HoI4 invites players to rewrite the course of history. 
                        HoI4 is the most popular on this list, but, in my opinion, it is not that good. Warfare in this game is really good but everything else (diplomacy, economy) is nothing in comparison to other Paradox games.
                        Also the story in this game is heavily directed by focuses witch make game less replayable.
